1 — Product overview
Flash Express backend: an operational shipping management system for clients, couriers, and admins. Responsibilities shown in server.js:

Accept shipments (single + CSV bulk), compute fees, persist shipments.
Manage users/roles, courier stats, transactions, wallets, payouts.
Packaging, assignment (manual and auto), delivery lifecycle and verification (SMS code).
Notifications (in-app, email, SMS), file evidence handling, periodic maintenance (overdue detection, tier updates, cleanup).
WebSocket updates for UI data sync.
Business goals

Reliable end-to-end shipment lifecycle with correct financial flows (COD/Transfer/Wallet).
Scalable bulk import and bulk operations (packaging, assign, status updates).
Accurate wallet and courier balances derived from transactions.
Admin tooling for resets, cleanup and debugging.
2 — Personas & primary journeys
Admin: configure tier settings, manage users/roles, view data, run DB resets/cleanups, process payouts.
Client: create shipments (single + CSV), fund wallet, request payouts (clients only), track shipments.
Courier: receive assignments, view tasks, request payouts; see commission history and penalties.
Customer/recipient: receive SMS delivery code, verify delivery.
Primary flows

Create shipment -> server re-calculates price/fees -> insert -> notify client -> packaging -> assign -> courier deliver -> delivery verification -> financial transactions updated.
Bulk CSV import -> server validates rows, creates shipments, handles Wallet/COD logic per-row.
Auto-assign packaged shipments -> chooses courier by zone and workload.
Payout lifecycle: request -> admin process/decline -> transactional records and balance recalculation.
3 — Functional features (mapped to server behaviors)
Authentication & User CRUD: /api/login, /api/users (create/update/delete/password).
Role management: /api/roles GET/POST/PUT/DELETE.
App data bulk fetch: /api/data (returns users, shipments, transactions, etc.) with parsing & balance recalculation logic.
Shipment lifecycle:
Create single: POST /api/shipments (server computes price, generates ID, charges wallet when needed).
Create bulk: POST /api/shipments/bulk-import (validates phone format, client existence, payment method, handles Wallet payments).
Update status: PUT /api/shipments/:id/status (supports revert flow).
Assign courier: PUT /api/shipments/:id/assign, auto-assign: POST /api/shipments/auto-assign.
Packaging: PUT /api/shipments/:id/packaging and POST /api/shipments/bulk-package.
Bulk operations: bulk-assign, bulk-status-update.
Fees update: PUT /api/shipments/:id/fees.
Delivery verification:
Send code: POST /api/shipments/:id/send-delivery-code (sends SMS via Twilio and stores code with expiry).
Verify: POST /api/shipments/:id/verify-delivery (on success triggers accounting and notifications).
Notifications: in-app + database notifications, email via nodemailer, SMS via Twilio.
Financial flows:
client_transactions, courier_transactions, wallet balance recalculation helper updateClientWalletBalance.
Courier payouts: POST /api/couriers/payouts, processing/decline endpoints for admin.
Client payouts/top-up endpoints.
Penalties endpoints for courier.
Inventory & Assets: CRUD endpoints for inventory and assets, packaging decrements inventory.
Supplier management and supplier transactions.
Partner tiers: tier_settings CRUD and auto-tier update job run daily.
Scheduled jobs:
Overdue shipments check (every 4 hours) -> create notifications.
Tier updates (daily).
Evidence & failure photo cleanup (hourly).
WebSocket: emits data_updated (throttled).
Admin/debug endpoints:
/api/debug/*, /api/debug/cleanup-database, /api/debug/reset-database, /api/admin/reset-database-complete (powerful; must be secured).
Static file serving: React dist and /uploads.
Graceful shutdown and DB setup with retries.
4 — API surface (selected endpoints, inputs, outputs, errors)
Notes: follow JSON body format; error responses use 4xx/5xx with error message.

POST /api/login

Input: { email, password }
Success: 200 { user (without password), roles parsed }
Errors: 401 invalid credentials, 500 server error
GET /api/data

Input: none (could be made auth-restricted)
Output: aggregated object { users, shipments, clientTransactions, courierStats, ... }
Behavior: recalculates wallet & courier balances (may update DB)
POST /api/shipments

Input: shipment payload including toAddress/fromAddress objects, paymentMethod (COD/Transfer/Wallet), packageValue, priority, clientId
Behavior: server computes price, creates deterministic shipment id, handles wallet charge, inserts transactions if needed
Success: 201 created shipment parsed
Errors: 500 with message on failure (insufficient wallet funds etc.)
POST /api/shipments/bulk-import

Input: { shipments: [...] } each row expects specific fields (clientEmail, recipientPhone formatted as +201..., packageValue, paymentMethod, fromCity/fromZone, toCity/toZone, etc.)
Behavior: per-row validation, wallet deduction for Wallet rows, inserts shipments and notifications, returns per-row success/failure array
Errors: 400 invalid payload, 200 with results array on completion.
PUT /api/shipments/:id/status

Input: { status, failureReason, failurePhoto (base64), isRevert }
Behavior: complex revert logic allowed for specific status transitions; file save for failure photos.
POST /api/shipments/:id/send-delivery-code

Input: none
Behavior: generates code, stores in delivery_verifications, sends SMS via Twilio and logs notification
POST /api/shipments/:id/verify-delivery

Input: { code }
Behavior: validates code + expiry, triggers processDeliveredShipment to credit transactions, courier/referrer commissions, update statuses
Courier & client financial endpoints: POST /api/couriers/:id/penalty, POST /api/couriers/payouts, PUT /api/payouts/:id/process, POST /api/clients/:id/payouts, POST /api/clients/:id/topup

Admin debug and reset endpoints exist; MUST be restricted to admin access in production.

5 — Data shapes (important fields)
Shipment (key fields)

id: string, price: number, packageValue: number, paymentMethod: 'COD'|'Transfer'|'Wallet'
status: string, statusHistory: JSON string/array
toAddress/fromAddress: JSON stringified object { street, details, city, zone }
clientId, clientFlatRateFee, courierId, courierCommission
amountToCollect, amountReceived (for Transfer)
packagingLog (JSON), packagingNotes
failurePhotoPath
creationDate
User

id, name/firstName/lastName, email, password (hashed), roles (JSON string), walletBalance (number), flatRateFee, zones, partnerTier, priorityMultipliers
Transactions

client_transactions, courier_transactions with id, userId/courierId, type, amount, date, status
Notifications: notifications, in_app_notifications

DB considerations

JSON fields may be stored as string (SQLite) or JSON/JSONB (Postgres). Code already has safeJsonParse utilities.
Many endpoints update derived balances by recalculating from transactions. This is the single source of truth for balances — keep transaction creation consistent.
Some admin endpoints call direct deletions/resets — need DB backups and audit.
6 — Edge cases and error modes
Wallet insufficient funds: create returns error (POST /api/shipments and wallet bulk rows will fail).
Phone validation: bulk-import enforces +201XXXXXXXXX format (server currently expects that). Frontend must normalize before sending.
Duplicate clients or missing client by email: bulk import will fail that row.
Delivery verification code expiry; re-sends should replace (onConflict merge) existing row.
Revert status only allowed for certain transitions — invalid revert should return 400.
Race conditions: shipment counter uses a forUpdate() lock; ensure sequence handling across multiple DB providers.
File uploads: base64 images saved to disk — validate size and type and set quotas.
7 — Non-functional & operational requirements
Authentication & Authorization: add token-based auth (JWT or session) and RBAC checks on admin/debug routes (currently missing).
Secrets: TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER, EMAIL_USER/PASS, DATABASE_URL must be in env/secrets; ensure no plaintext API keys are stored in repo.
Rate-limiting on public endpoints (/api/track, /api/login, /api/shipments/bulk-import)
Monitoring & Alerts: job failures, queue/backlog thresholds, DB errors, disk usage for uploads.
Scalability: heavy /api/data requests fetch all rows; consider paging and filtered endpoints.
Backups: scheduled DB backups, especially before any admin reset endpoints.
Logging: sensitive info redaction in logs (passwords, API keys).
File storage: consider moving evidence/failure photos to object storage (S3) rather than filesystem for scaling.
8 — Acceptance criteria & tests (minimal set)
Unit tests:
Price calculation for each payment method and priority multiplier.
Wallet charge flow and transaction creation.
Courier commission calculation and referral bonus logic.
Bulk-import row validation and result reporting.
Delivery verification lifecycle (send code, verify, processDeliveredShipment side-effects).
Integration tests:
End-to-end create -> package -> assign -> deliver flow including DB updates.
Bulk package + bulk assign flows (inventory decrement).
Auto-assign chooses couriers by zone and lowest workload.
Smoke tests:
/api/health, /api/data returns expected shaped response.
WebSocket emits data_updated when an action occurs (throttle respected).
Security tests:
Ensure admin debug endpoints are blocked for non-admins.
Secrets not leaked in logs or repository.
9 — Metrics & SLAs (recommendations)
API latency P95 < 300ms for non-heavy endpoints; bulk endpoints allowed higher.
Bulk import: report rows/sec and failures ratio; aim < 1% failure for valid CSVs.
Scheduled jobs must complete in under 2 minutes for typical DB sizes.
Uptime target: 99.9% for core APIs.
10 — Risks & mitigations
Debug/admin endpoints in code: risk of accidental destructive use. Mitigate: require admin auth + confirmation + backups.
Balances derived from transactions: risk if past transactions edited/deleted. Mitigate: immutability/audit logs for transactions.
Large /api/data responses cause timeouts: mitigate with pagination or streaming.
File storage on local disk: scale to S3 and add retention policies.
11 — Implementation roadmap (short)
Phase 1 (stabilize)
Add auth middleware & RBAC; restrict debug endpoints.
Move secret keys out of repo; rotate exposed keys.
Add unit tests for price/transaction logic and bulk import.
Phase 2 (scale & UX)
Paginated data endpoints; background job for heavy recalculation.
Replace local file storage with S3-compatible storage.
Add rate limiting and monitoring.
Phase 3 (polish)
Add admin UI for safe database reset with backups.
Performance tuning for bulk import and auto-assign algorithm.
12 — Immediate low-risk improvements I recommend now
Remove or protect debug endpoints in production (check process.env.NODE_ENV).
Ensure bulk-import phone validation aligns with frontend normalization (server expects +201XXXXXXXXX).
Stop storing API keys in repo files like .mcp.json — move to environment secrets.
Add RBAC checks and require admin token for endpoints that delete/reset DB.
13 — Acceptance checklist for delivery
All endpoints documented with request/response examples (I can generate OpenAPI spec).
Unit and integration tests added and passing.
Admin/debug endpoints protected and documented.
Secrets removed from repo and env variables configured for deployment.
Migration or schema aligned with payloads (e.g., ensure no frontend field like shippingFeeIncluded is being inserted to DB incorrectly).
Questions / missing info to finalize PRD
Auth model: do you want JWT-based stateless tokens or session-based auth? (server currently returns user on login but no token.)
Which endpoints must remain accessible publicly (track, health)? Are there client-specific API keys for public tracking?
Expected CSV formats and sample size for bulk-import (max rows per request)? Current server expects recipientPhone in +201... format — confirm this with frontend.
Do you want to persist any CSV-only flags (e.g., shippingFeeIncluded) in DB, or should they be computed only?
Backup & retention policy for evidence/failure photos (current cleanup runs hourly to remove >3 days).
Are there external SLAs for email/SMS delivery (Twilio / SMTP)? Any fallback channels required?
Would you like me to:
generate OpenAPI (Swagger) for all endpoints,
add basic auth middleware and protect debug routes,
or create unit tests for price and transaction logic?
Pick which follow-ups you'd like me to implement next and I’ll proceed (I can generate an OpenAPI draft, add auth middleware, and/or implement protection for debug endpoints).

Restore Checkpoint
Use the most efficient authentication method.
keep them all publically accessable for now but comment it so it can later be patched,
Check if it is patched in the front end.
Yes, keep it in the database and adjust the database to work, ensure you back up everything and ensure that the database does not fail.
Yes. Evidence should be cleaned up after 3 days, make the checks every 4 hours if it costs less for the server hosting.
