3. Submit app for WhatsApp Business approval
4. **Result**: Can send to any valid phone number globally

## 🔄 Current Behavior:

```
Production Flow:
1. Try WhatsApp Business API ❌ (Test mode - phone not verified)
2. Fall back to Twilio ✅ (Working perfectly)
3. Message sent successfully via Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox
```

## ⚡ Immediate Action Required:

**For testing purposes right now:**
